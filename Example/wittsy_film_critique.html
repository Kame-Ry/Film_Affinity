        <h2>Critique</h2>
        <p>Wittsy, your film ratings showcase a diverse range of interests, from classics to modern blockbusters, indie gems to animated delights. You appreciate storytelling complexity and emotional depth, as seen in your high ratings for "Palm Springs" and "Moonlight." However, there are instances where your ratings may overlook cinematic nuances, such as downplaying the artistry of "Hereditary" and "Black Panther." To expand your cinematic horizon, consider exploring more international films like "Parasite," which blend social commentary with suspenseful storytelling. Delve into the works of auteurs like Wong Kar-wai, known for visually stunning narratives in films like "In the Mood for Love." Embrace genres beyond your comfort zone to appreciate the vast landscape of cinema fully.</p>
